Source for Cornell's Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
Cornell's MCM is an annual competition to apply modeling techniques to a select problem in a team of three.
The code here was a part of a much larger analysis for the contest, where the included pieces are those of which I am the sole author. 
Significany papers were written for each year with visualizations and explanations of methods, however these are not included here as they were written in collaboration with my team.
